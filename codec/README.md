# Codec ConfigData Repo

## Brief

This is a part of my Conf repo  which should be a submodule. But now I just
keep it in this repo's 'codec' dir, this part contains some codec desc files of dell 5437
and thinkpad t470. I use this files to draw ConfigData for AppleALC. 

The `hda-verb` is a powerful tool which can work with CodecCommand.kext, and
some scripts like `widget_dump.sh` and `node_dump.sh` can use it to dump some
infomation of our HDA device's node.
